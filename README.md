## ESPHome adapter for ioBroker

Control your ESP8266/ESP32 with simple yet powerful configuration files created and managed by ESPHome.
The adapter will connect to ESPHome managed device by its native API and ensur all data is synchronised (live-event handling, no data polling ! :)

This adapter use the [esphome-native-api](https://github.com/Nafaya/esphome-native-api#readme) with all credits to @Nafaya, thank you!

## [Documentation](https://DrozmotiX.github.io/languages/en/ESPHome/)

All our adapter documentation can be found at [The DrozmotiX Docu Page](https://DrozmotiX.github.io)

## Prerequisites

You should be familiar how to use ESPHome and add devices/sensor to a the YAML file.
